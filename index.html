<h1>Git Quiz</h1>

<h4>What is Git and why is it so important?</h4>
<p>Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, 
and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to. Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source.</p>

<h4>What’s a branch and why do we create them?</h4>

<p>In Git, branches are a part of your everyday development process. Git branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your changes. When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug—no matter how big or how small—you spawn a new branch to encapsulate your changes.</p>

<h4>What’s the working tree?</h4>
<p>The working tree, or working directory, consists of files that you are currently working on. You can think of a working tree as a file system where you can view and modify files. The index, or staging area, is where commits are prepared. The index compares the files in the working tree to the files in the repo.</p>


<h4>What’s the staging area?</h4>

<p>
    A staging area (otherwise staging point, staging base, or staging post) is a location where organisms, people, vehicles, equipment, or material are assembled before use.</p>

<h4>What’s the command to retrieve the latest version of your files from the remote serve?</h4>
<p>Solution 1: Get the latest code and reset the code git fetch origin git reset --hard origin/[tag/branch/commit-id usually: master]</p>
